# Noise-Robust Speaker Verification with Attenuated Speech Restoration and Consistency Training
This repository accompanies our paper:
"Noise-Robust Speaker Verification with Attenuated Speech Restoration and Consistency Training". <br>
Currently under revision process for IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing. <br>
We provide our implementation as open source in this repository.

## Pre-requisites
Please refer [requirements.txt](https://github.com/aryanorb/NRSV-RC/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## Data Preparation
For dataloader and MUSAN noise split, we referred to the implementation from (https://github.com/wngh1187/ExU-Net).
