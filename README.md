# Noise-Robust Speaker Verification with Attenuated Speech Restoration and Consistency Training
This repository accompanies our paper:

* **Title** : "Noise-Robust Speaker Verification with Attenuated Speech Restoration and Consistency Training"

Currently under revision process for IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing. <br>
We provide our implementation as open source in this repository.<br>


## Environment Setting
Please refer [requirements.txt](https://github.com/aryanorb/NRSV-RC/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## 📁 Data Preparation
For the dataloader and MUSAN noise split, we referred to the implementations from [ExU-Net](https://github.com/wngh1187/ExU-Net) and [ECAPA-TDNN](https://github.com/TaoRuijie/ECAPA-TDNN).


## 📝 Note
DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) implementation will be released soon.
